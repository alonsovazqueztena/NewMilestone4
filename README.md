# Full-Stack Login and Register Page Using MERN Stack

Welcome to our project on building a full-stack login and register page using MERN stack. In this project, we will cover creating a secure and functional login and register page using React.js, MongoDB, Express, Bcrypt, JWT, and more.

## Project Overview
Here we will use thr MERN stack and how it can be used to build powerful and secure web applications. We will discuss authentication, authorization, encrypting user's passwords for extra security, and tracking users with a cookie using JSON Web Tokens.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the front-end user interface.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data securely.
- **Express.js**: Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing and securing user passwords.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **React-hot-toast**: To display professional looking notifications.

## Directory Structure
- **/client**: Contains all client-side code.
  - **/context**: React context for state management.
  - **/public**: Public assets and HTML files.
  - **/src**: Source files for React components and pages.
    - **/assets**: Static files like images and styles.
    - **/components**: Reusable React components.
    - **/pages**: React components representing pages.
- **/server**: Server-side code.
  - **/controllers**: Functions to handle requests.
  - **/helpers**: Helper functions for things like JWT.
  - **/models**: Mongoose models for MongoDB.
  - **/routes**: Express routes to manage API requests.
